Maven was used for dependency management of the app. PSQL client was used to directly access the database and verify integrity of performed operations.",
        "Grep App: Developed and deployed a Java app that mimics the functionality of the 'grep' command in Linux. The algorithm consists of a recursive search from a root path to locate the input file; lines that match the user-specified Java regex will be stored into an output file. Maven was used for dependency management of the app. Docker was used to deploy the app to DockerHub."

  "summary": "I completed my Bachelor's of Engineering degree in Computer Engineering at York University. Prior to university, I naturally gravitated towards logic and mathematical concepts. Eventually, I was introduced to programming which made me decide that I wanted to be able to solve real world problems using software. This led me down the path to Jarvis. At Jarvis, I learned about agile development practices while I worked with team members to develop software deliverables. I worked on several software development projects such as a Linux/SQL resource monitor, and a Java clone of the \"grep\" command in Linux using technologies like Docker, Maven, and PostgreSQL databases. In doing these projects, I hope to further my career in either full-stack development or quality assurance testing, with an added interest in project management."
