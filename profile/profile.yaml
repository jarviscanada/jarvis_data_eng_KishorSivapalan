summary: Hello, my name is Kishor! I completed my Bachelor's of Engineering degree in Computer Engineering at York University. When I was younger, I had a tendency to build 
  and create things, while also looking at how things are designed. Once my parents introduced me to my first game console, I realised that I wanted to pursue something in the 
  technological field. I wanted to be able to solve real world problems using software which led me down the path to Jarvis. At Jarvis, I worked on several software development
  projects such as a Linux/SQL resource monitor, and a Java clone of the "grep" command in Linux. In doing these projects, I hope to further my career in either full-stack 
  development or quality assurance, with an added interest in project management.
