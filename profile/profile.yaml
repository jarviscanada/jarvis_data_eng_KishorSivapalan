# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I completed my Bachelor's of Engineering degree in Computer Engineering at York University. Prior to university, I naturally gravitated towards logic and mathematical concepts. 
  Eventually, I was introduced to programming which made me decide that I wanted to be able to solve real world problems using software. 
  This led me down the path to Jarvis. At Jarvis, I learned about agile development practices while I worked with team members to develop software deliverables. 
  I worked on several software development projects such as a Linux/SQL resource monitor, and a Java clone of the "grep" command in Linux using technologies like Docker, Maven, and PostgreSQL databases. 
  In doing these projects, I hope to further my career in either full-stack development or quality assurance testing, with an added interest in project management.

    description: "Developed and deployed a monitoring agent that periodically records hardware information and resource usage data from a node in a cluster. 
    The design consists of bash scripts that initialize a PostgreSQL database instance generated by Docker, and scripts that record the needed hardware information. 
    Scripts are run on a per-minute basis using crontab automation."

      - "JDBC App: Developed and Java app that uses the JDBC API and a DAO design pattern to be able to perform CRUD operations on a PostgreSQL database running on a Docker container. 
      Maven was used for dependency management of the app. PSQL client was used to directly access the database and verify integrity of performed operations."
      - "Grep App: Developed and deployed a Java app that mimics the functionality of the 'grep' command in Linux. 
      The algorithm consists of a recursive search from a root path to locate the input file; lines that match the user-specified Java regex will be stored into an output file.
      Maven was used for dependency management of the app. Docker was used to deploy the app to DockerHub."
